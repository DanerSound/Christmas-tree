[![personal-label](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=DanerSound&message=Work_in_progress&color=red&logo=github)](https://github.com/DanerSound)

The purpose of this repository is to create a simple tree using an asterisk (*) symbol and a text message in as many programming languages as possible.

## Introduction

During the Christmas season, I started this project with the aim of spreading holiday cheer. The text message used in the trees is "Buon Natale," which means "Merry Christmas" in Italian.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a programming language. Inside each folder, you will find a simple program or script that generates a tree pattern using asterisks and displays the message "Buon Natale"

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding a new programming language or improving existing implementations. Make sure to follow the directory structure and include a brief explanation of your code.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a folder for the programming language you want to add.
3. Write a program in that language to generate the tree.
4. Include a brief README or comments in your code explaining how it works.
5. Submit a pull request.
