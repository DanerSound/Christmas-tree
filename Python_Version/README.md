 The purpose of this program is to print a tree using the simbol " * " and also a generic greeting for Christmas.
 Here you will find the description for the main procedure.
 
 To be able to print _tree_ and _text_ **aligned** we need to print 5 empty spaces before the first asterisco.
 Just because the number of asterisk is increasing in the array **"simbols_occurences"** we need to manage to print 
 some proper spaces.
 The for_cicle of line 26-27 print all the simbols in the right positions. Befor start a new print cycle, we print a 
 newLine. when print is done, the greeting message can be printed.
